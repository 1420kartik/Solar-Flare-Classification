# Solar-Flare-Classification
Solar flares result from the sudden release of magnetic energy stored in the Sun, posing potential risks to Earth's communication and infrastructure. Extreme class imbalance and high-dimensional time series data pose challenges. The study aims to use MINIROCKET and other classifiers for real-time flare prediction.
